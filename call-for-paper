                <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
                <p>Accepted and presented papers will be included into the conference proceedings. Distinguished papers
                    presented at the conference, after further revision, will be published in special issues of selected
                    journals.</p>
                <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
                <p href="">Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are
                    simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Authors must submit their
                    papers by the deadline indicated below, <br>using the <a
                        href="https://easychair.org/account/signin?l=aLGS3MVvHOSmy1YXqT3sst">EasyChair submission
                        system.</a><br>‍<br>Only PDF files will be accepted. Manuscripts need to be prepared according
                    to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE CS
                        format </a>. All regular paper submissions should be written in English with a maximum paper
                    length of 8 pages, including references and everything. All submitted papers will be reviewed by at
                    least three experts.<br><br>The conference and program chairs also invite researchers to submit
                    original short papers. Short papers provide an opportunity to describe significant novel work in
                    progress or research that is best communicated in an interactive or graphical format. Compared to
                    full papers, their contribution may be narrower in scope, be applied to a narrower set of
                    application domains, or have weaker empirical support than that expected for a full paper.
                    Submissions likely to generate discussions in new and emerging areas of cloud computing and emerging
                    applications are especially encouraged.<br>‍<br>Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.
                    At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference, by the early date
                    indicated by the organizers, and present the paper.<br>‍<br>The conference proceedings of CloudCom
                    2022 will be published by IEEE Conference Publishing Service with ISBN and ISSN, and submitted to
                    IEEE Xplore and indexing services such as Ei Compendex. Distinguished papers will be recommended for
                    fast-track publication in the IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing or invited to be included within
                    a number of special issues in prestigious international journals.<br><br><em>The PDF file of Call

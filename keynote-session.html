                    was employed at Yahoo! where he was porting and parallelizing several data-intensive
                    applications on Yahoo! Grids based on Hadoop (Map Reduce Programming Paradigm). He built
                    Hadoop Vaidya, a performance diagnostic tool for Map/Reduce jobs. Vaidya is automated to
                    process thousands of Grid jobs running daily. He contributes to various open-source projects
                    such as Airflow, Pig, Hive, Oozie, and HCatalog. He received the Yahoo! award in 2008 for
                    evangelizing Grid technologies, profiling, and optimizing Map Reduce applications. Viraj Bhat
                    graduated with a Ph.D. degree (May 2008) in the Department of Electrical and Computer
                    Engineering under the guidance of Professor Manish Parashar. He used to be a visiting
                    researcher at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in Princeton, New Jersey. Viraj
                    has been involved in several research projects at Rutgers, PPPL, and ORNL, including Autonomic
                    Data Management, AutoMate/Accord, DISCOVER, and CORBACoG at CAIP (Rutgers University)
                    and Development of Systems for Distributed Scientific Data Management using Automated
                    Workflows Applied to Plasma Physics Simulations (PPPL).
